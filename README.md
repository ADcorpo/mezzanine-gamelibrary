# mezzanine-gamelibrary

This module is part of a side project based on
[mezzanine](https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine). It allows to
easily centralize informations about games that appear in the
website's blog posts.

## Features
1. Easily link articles to games, manage a full collection of games with various properties such as genre, editor,â€¦
2. Made with mezzanine integration in mind - painless installation on your existing mezzanine project

## Installation

As of now, the easiest way to install would be to clone this repo and
link the module folder in your project's file hierarchy.

A more standard way (setup.py) is coming.
